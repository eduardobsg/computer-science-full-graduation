1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
The story so far,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,500
In 1980, just four years after being founded
in a Californian garage,

3
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:12,202
Apple was the biggest maker of PCs in the world.

4
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:18,304
Computer giant IBM was not amused and fought back,
launching its own PC in 1981.

5
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:21,305
Though built from copy-cat technology,

6
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:26,706
IBM's PC was an enormous hit and spawned many imitators,
the PC clones.

7
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:33,007
But PCs were still a pain to use.
A revolution was needed to make them friendlier.

8
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,508
Now, view on.

9
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:30,218
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the launch of Windows 95.

10
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,519
Yes, welcome Microsoftees nice to have you all here.

11
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,020
But now let's welcome the chairman of Microsoft.

12
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:43,321
Listen to this. This is a man, a man so successful
his chaffeur is Ross Perot ladies and gentlemen...

13
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,522
please welcome Bill Gates.

14
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:53,923
It's August 24th, 1995.

15
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:56,724
In a suburb of Seattle in the Pacific Northwest,

16
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:01,425
this is the biggest, noisiest product launch
in the history of the personal computer.

17
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:08,926
It's Windows 95 software - and Bill Gates is the star, chairman,
chief nerd and spiritual leader of Microsoft.

18
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:16,027
This is the latest step in Bill's dream to have
his software running on every PC in the world.

19
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:19,028
Bill Gates: We wanted people to be able to appreciate

20
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:25,129
how Windows 95 makes computing
faster, easier and more fun.

21
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,230
And for seven years it was a lonely, lonely crusade...

22
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:36,531
this moves the whole PC industry up to a whole new level...

23
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:42,032
Wait a minute all this publicity is so Bill Gates
can claim that Windows 95 is the latest

24
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,733
and perhaps the most significant improvement
in the PC since it was invented.

25
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:51,534
He can say that his new operating system makes PC's
nicer to look at and easier to use than ever before.

26
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:57,335
They'll no longer be just for geeks and nerds they'll be
so easy to use that even my mother will want one...

27
00:02:57,536 --> 00:03:02,536
but you know what - most of the ideas in Windows 95
were invented twenty years ago.

28
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:10,537
The 20 year journey to this software celebration hasn't been easy.

29
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:15,338
It has involved huge gambles,
passionate commitment, dramatic setbacks

30
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,439
and required the occasional crushing of rivals and allies.

31
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,040
It's the triumph of Bill Gates' commercial vision.

32
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:28,341
Success in the market place doesn't have to come
from innovation, or from being the best,

33
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,042
if you have a ruthless ability to exploit your opportunities.

34
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:40,543
And the way Microsoft made the PC's graphical user interface
its own is a textbook example of that ability.

35
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:47,544
Time for another Cringely crash course in elementary computing.

36
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:51,345
In the early days of personal computing
the machines were pretty hard to use

37
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,346
in part that's because they were primitive

38
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:57,347
but it's also because computer guys
tend to like things that are pretty hard to use.

39
00:03:57,548 --> 00:04:01,048
This is an IBM PC circa about 1983

40
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:04,349
and on it I have written a letter to my bank manager

41
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,850
asking him to back one of my get rich quick schemes

42
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:12,851
and I need to file the letter now and let me show you
how I do it - there will be a test on this.

43
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:18,552
OK the commands are - copy c, colon, backslash,

44
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:26,053
quickrich, dot, doc space a colon backslash

45
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:33,054
begging and return - well not very easy to do.

46
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:38,055
Here's a windows PC about twelve years newer
and we'll do exactly the same thing

47
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:44,556
I've written a document - quickrich, dot doc
and I put it in the begging file

48
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:48,557
and it yes I really do mean to do it and that's it.

49
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:53,558
Pictures rather than words making the PC easy and intuitive.

50
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:58,359
This is called a graphical user interface - GUI or gooey

51
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
where they come up with these names.

52
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:04,561
The battle to bring gooeys to PCs
and make them more user friendly

53
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:09,062
took ten years and is a helluva story
that is what this program is about.

54
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:14,063
It's also about how Bill Gates ended up
master of the gooey universe and a gazillionaire.

55
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,564
I never said it was a fairy story.

56
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:23,565
It all began in 1971 in Palo Alto,
just south of San Francisco,

57
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:29,566
when Xerox, the copier company, set up the
Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC.

58
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,067
The Xerox management had a sinking feeling

59
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,568
that if people started reading
computer screens instead of paper,

60
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:40,069
Xerox was in trouble.

61
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,570
Unless... they could dominate
the paperless office of the future.

62
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:52,071
You could take computer technology into the office
and make the office a much better place to work,

63
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,072
more productive, more enjoyable

64
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:58,573
a lot more enjoyable, ehm more interesting,

65
00:05:59,073 --> 00:06:03,373
more rewarding and so we set to work on it.

66
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:06,374
Bob Taylor ran the PARC's Computer Science Lab

67
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,575
and one of the first things he did was to buy

68
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,076
bean bags for his researchers to sit on and brainstorm.

69
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:14,577
Here's a couple of the original beanbag chairs.

70
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:19,078
The role of the beanbag in computer science is ease of use.
- OK.

71
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,579
It was said that of the top 100 computer researchers in the world,
58 worked at PARC.

72
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Strange, as the staff never exceeded 50.

73
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:29,581
See you didn't get your butt low enough...

74
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:34,582
But Taylor gave these nerd geniuses unlimited resources
and protected them from commercial pressures.

75
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,583
BOB: It's very comfortable.

76
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:36,584
BOB TAYLOR: Now let's see you get out of it.

77
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:41,085
BOB: I feel my neural capacity already increasing - Oh God...

78
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:47,086
The atmosphere was electric eh there was total intellectual freedom.

79
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:53,087
There was no conventional wisdom almost every idea
was up for challenge and got challenged regularly.

80
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:57,088
The management said go create the new world.

81
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,589
We don't understand it.

82
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,090
Here are people who have a lot of ideas
and tremendous talent, young, energetic.

83
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:10,091
People came there specifically to work
on five year programs that were their dreams.

84
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:16,092
This is a computer room in the basement of
the Xerox Pala Alto Research Centre...

85
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:20,093
about twenty five years ago they built
the max time sharing system in here

86
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:26,094
and now it's loaded with all sorts of other computers
and eh there's one that we're really interested in here

87
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:31,095
let's see... here it is... let me turn on the lights.

88
00:07:32,596 --> 00:07:34,596
OK, here we have it.

89
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:39,597
This is a Xerox/Alto computer built around 1973.

90
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,598
Some people would argue that this is the first personal computer.

91
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,599
Ah it really isn't because for one thing
it wasn't ever for sale

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,500
and the parts alone cost about $10,000 but
it has all the elements of quite a modern personal computer

93
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,501
and without it we wouldn't have the Macintosh, we wouldn't have Windows

94
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:58,002
we wouldn't have most of the things we value in computing today

95
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:02,003
and ironically none of those things has a Xerox name on it.

96
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:04,508
Commercial:
What's the mail this morning?

97
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:09,009
This promotional film made in the mid seventies,
to flaunt XEROX PARC research,

98
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,510
shows just how revolutionary the Alto was.

99
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,011
It was friendly and intuitive.

100
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:17,512
Commercial:
This is an experimental office system. It's in use now...

101
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:22,013
It had the first GUI using a mouse to
point to information on the screen.

102
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:26,514
It was linked to other PCs, by a system called ethernet,
the first computer network.

103
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:31,015
And what you saw on the screen was precisely
what you got on your laser printer.

104
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,016
It was way ahead of its time.

105
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:34,017
Commercial:
Thank you Fred.

106
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:37,518
Everybody wanted to make a real difference,
we really thought that we were changing the world

107
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:43,019
and that at the end of this project or this set of projects

108
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:52,020
personal computing would burst on the scene exactly the way
we had envisioned it and take everybody by total surprise.

109
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:59,021
But the brilliant researchers at PARC could never persuade
the Xerox management that their vision was accurate.

110
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:04,022
Head Office in New York ignored the revolutionary technologies
they owned three thousand miles away.

111
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,023
They just didn't get it.

112
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:11,524
And none of the main body of the company
was prepared to accept the answers.

113
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:18,525
So there was a tremendous mismatch between
the management and what the researchers were doing

114
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:23,526
and these guys had never fantasised about
what the future of the office was going to be

115
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:30,027
and when it was presented to them they had no mechanisms
for turning those ideas into real live products

116
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:37,528
and that was really the frustrating part of it because
you were talking to people who didn't understand the vision

117
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:43,029
and yet the vision was getting created everyday
within the Palo Alto Research Centre

118
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,530
and there was no one to receive that vision.

119
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:53,031
But a few miles down the road from Palo Alto
was a man ready to share the vision.

120
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:58,032
The most dangerous man in Silicon Valley
sits in an office in this building.

121
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:00,533
People love him and hate him.
Often at the same time.

122
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:07,034
For ten years by sheer force of will he made
the personal computer industry follow his direction.

123
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:13,535
With this guy we're not talking about someone driven by the profit motive
in a desire for an opulent retirement at the age of forty,

124
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:21,036
no we're talking holy war we're talking rivers of blood
and fields of dead martyrs to the cause of greater computing.

125
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,537
We're talking about a guy who sees the personal computer
as his tool for changing the world.

126
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,038
We're talking about Steve Jobs.

127
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:36,039
Hi, I'm Steve Jobs.

128
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,540
When I wasn't sure what the word charisma meant,
I met Steve Jobs and then I knew.

129
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,541
Steve Jobs is on my eternal heroes list,
there's nothing he can ever do to get off it.

130
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:57,542
He wanted you to be great and he wanted you
to create something that was great

131
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:01,043
and he was going to make you do that.

132
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:09,044
He's also obnoxious and this comes from his high standards.

133
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:16,545
He has extremely high standards and he has no patience with people
who don't either share those standards or perform to them.

134
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,546
And I'm also one of these people.

135
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:28,547
I don't really care about being right
you know I just care about success.

136
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:34,548
Steve Jobs had co-founded Apple Computer in 1976.

137
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:39,049
The first popular personal computer, the Apple 2, was a hit

138
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,550
and made Steve Jobs one of the biggest names in a brand-new industry.

139
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:48,551
At the height of Apple's early success in December 1979,

140
00:11:48,552 --> 00:11:54,052
Jobs, then all of 24, had a privileged invitation to visit Xerox Parc.

141
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:57,553
And they showed me really three things.

142
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:03,554
But I was so blinded by the first one that
I didn't even really see the other two.

143
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:11,555
One of the things they showed me was object orienting programming
they showed me that but I didn't even see that.

144
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:15,056
The other one they showed me was a networked computer system...

145
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:19,557
they had over a hundred Alto computers all networked using email etc., etc.,

146
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:21,558
I didn't even see that.

147
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:27,059
I was so blinded by the first thing they showed me
which was the graphical user interface.

148
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,560
I thought it was the best thing I'd ever seen in my life.

149
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:35,561
Now remember it was very flawed, what we saw was incomplete,
they'd done a bunch of things wrong.

150
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:42,062
But we didn't know that at the time but still
though they had the germ of the idea was there and they'd done it very well

151
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:51,063
and within you know ten minutes it was obvious to me
that all computers would work like this some day.

152
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:53,064
It was a turning-point.

153
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:56,565
Jobs decided that this was the way forward for Apple.

154
00:12:56,566 --> 00:13:05,566
He came back and I almost said asked, but the truth is,
demanded that his entire programming team

155
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:12,567
get a demo of the Smalltalk System
and the then head of the science centre

156
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:19,068
asked me to give the demo because Steve specifically asked
for me to give the demo and I said no way.

157
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:27,069
I had a big argument with these Xerox executives telling them
that they were about to give away the kitchen sink

158
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,570
and I said that I would only do it
if I were ordered to do it

159
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:36,071
cause then of course it would be their responsibility,
and that's what they did.

160
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:41,572
Demonstration:
The mouse is a pointing device that moves
a cursor around the display screen.

161
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:47,573
Adele and her colleagues showed the Apple programmers
an Alto machine running a graphical user interface.

162
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:55,574
Demonstration:
A selected window displays above other windows much like
place a piece of paper on top of a stack on a desk.

163
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:59,075
The visitors from Apple saw a computer
that was designed to be easy to use,

164
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:05,076
a machine that anybody could operate
and find friendly...even the French.

165
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:10,077
I think mostly what we got in that hour and a half

166
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:17,078
was inspiration and basically just sort of
a bolstering of our convictions that

167
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:25,579
a more graphical way to do things would make
this business computer more accessible.

168
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,080
After an hour looking at demos
they understood our technology, and what it meant

169
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:34,581
more than any Xerox executive understood
after years of showing it to them.

170
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:40,082
Basically they were copier heads that just had
no clue about a computer or what it could do.

171
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:46,083
And so they just grabbed eh grabbed defeat from
the greatest victory in the computer industry.

172
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:49,084
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry today.

173
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,585
Could have been you know a company ten times its size.

174
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:55,586
Could have been IBM
could have been the IBM of the nineties.

175
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:57,587
Could have been the Microsoft of the nineties.

176
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:02,588
For Steve Jobs the road to Damascus passed through Palo Alto.

177
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:08,589
He persuaded the Apple board to invest in technology
copying what he'd seen at Xerox Parc - his instrument of change.

178
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,590
They hired a hundred engineers and started
developing a new PC codenamed Lisa.

179
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:15,091
But there were problems.

180
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:20,092
The Lisa didn't work properly and the
pricetag was heading toward $10,000

181
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,593
way too much for the average PC buyer.

182
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:30,094
Jobs' domineering style drove everyone nuts too
so the board ousted him from his own pet project.

183
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,095
You know I brooded for a few months,

184
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:37,096
but it was not very long after that
that it really occurred to me that

185
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:41,597
if we didn't do something here the
Apple 2 was running out of gas

186
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:46,598
and we needed to do something
with this technology fast or else

187
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:49,599
Apple might cease to exist as the company that it was.

188
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,500
Jobs got his answer from Jeff Raskin,
Apple employee number 31.

189
00:15:56,501 --> 00:16:01,501
Raskin's idea was a $600 computer
as easy to use as a toaster

190
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,502
code-named Macintosh, after America's favourite apple.

191
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:09,003
Jobs liked the price but not Raskin's design ideas.

192
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:14,004
So Steve took over the Macintosh project,
determined to make it a cheaper Lisa.

193
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:18,005
And so I formed a small team to do the Macintosh

194
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:23,006
and we were on a mission from God
you know to save Apple.

195
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:29,507
While jobs persude his Mac mission,
he needed a more orthodox chief executive to run the company.

196
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:32,508
A respectable face, who could sell to corporate america.

197
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,509
He chose Pepsi-Cola executive, John sculley.

198
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:42,510
Sculley refused, Leave pepsi for a four year old company
that had been setup in a garage! Are you serious?!

199
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:46,011
But it was hard saying - No, to Steve jobs.

200
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:52,512
And then he looked up at me and just stared at me
with the stare that only Steve Jobs has

201
00:16:52,513 --> 00:17:00,013
and he said do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life
or do you want to come with me and change the world

202
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:08,014
and I just gulped because I knew I would wonder
for the rest of my life what I would have missed.

203
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:13,615
For the young Mac team, average age 21,

204
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:18,116
this was the start of the toughest,
but most exhilarating assignment of their lives,

205
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,617
relentlessly driven by Jobs' ego.

206
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:24,518
BOB: Oh look at this and who is
this fresh-faced young guy here?

207
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,019
ANDY: That's me eleven years ago

208
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,020
had more hair I guess little thinner.

209
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,021
Oh I love these people.

210
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,522
They're like family to me really

211
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:39,523
and we were united by this common bond of trying
to do this incredible thing with the Mac.

212
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:43,524
Jobs wanted the Mac to revolutionise the PC market

213
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:47,525
so he insisted that the team deliver perfection.

214
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:50,826
Steve was upset that the Mac took too long to boot

215
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:54,527
to boot up when you first turned it on
so he tried motivating Larry Kenyon

216
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:58,528
by telling him well you know how many millions
of people are going to buy this machine

217
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:02,529
it's going to be millions of people
and let's imagine that

218
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:09,530
you can make it boot five seconds faster well that's
five seconds times a million every day that's fifty lifetimes,

219
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:15,031
if you can shave five seconds off
that you're saving fifty lives.

220
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:18,532
And so it was a nice way of thinking about it,

221
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,533
And we did get it to go faster.

222
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:24,534
And then this is one of the
very first Macintosh wire-wrap.

223
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,535
This is wire-wrap board No. 4.

224
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:30,536
As the Mac progressed, new features
were being continually added.

225
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:35,037
Jobs said the Mac had to be 'insanely great' and
pushed his engineers to the limit.

226
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,538
He had to - because by early 1983,
Apple was in trouble.

227
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,039
And this was what was giving Apple such a headache...

228
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,540
IBM's first PC launched in 1981.

229
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,041
It was a runaway success.

230
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:53,042
Within a couple of years more than
2 million units had been shipped

231
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:57,043
overtaking Apple and making Big Blue
the biggest player in the market.

232
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:05,544
Commercial:
When IBM personal computer owners look for good software
where can they turn - to IBM.

233
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,045
What was driving IBM PC sales was software...

234
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:13,546
Commercial:
Business programs, entertainment, productivity, education.

235
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:16,547
But software for an IBM wouldn't run on the Mac.

236
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:21,048
If the Macintosh was to succeed
Jobs needed killer applications.

237
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,549
Enter 25 year old software supremo Bill Gates.

238
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,050
At that time his company Microsoft
had one hundred workers

239
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:32,551
and was growing like crazy thanks to DOS,

240
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,552
the operating system that drove the IBM PC.

241
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:37,553
But DOS sure wasn't a GUI.

242
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:43,554
Gates and his aggressive number 2 Steve Ballmer
were immediately intrigued by the Mac.

243
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:47,055
Jobs talked to Bill at some industry conference
and said hey we're doing,

244
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:50,056
I think LISA was sort of in
development and he said

245
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:53,557
But i'm gonna do the graphical
interface machine here at Apple

246
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:59,058
Not just that LISA thing Bill I'm going to do the one
the one that's really going to be the winner.

247
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,059
While the Mac was being developed,

248
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,560
Jobs staged an event,
a parody of a TV game show,

249
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:08,561
to whip up enthusiasm among software developers.

250
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:12,562
And now ladies and gentlemen
the Macintosh Software Dating Game...

251
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:17,563
Jobs got the three top software bosses
of the time to sing the Mac's praises.

252
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:20,064
One of them was Bill Gates.

253
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:25,065
Steve didn't realise he was opening the door to the man
who'd prove to be Apple's main rival.

254
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,066
JOBS: When was your first date with the Macintosh?

255
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:32,567
GATES: We've been working with the Mac
for almost two years now

256
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:37,068
and we put some of our really good people on it and eh...

257
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,569
Even before we finished our work on the IBM PC,

258
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,570
Steve Jobs came and talked about what he wanted to do

259
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:49,071
that he thought he could do sort of a LISA but cheaper.

260
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,572
We said boy we'd love to help out.

261
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:53,573
The LISA had all its own applications

262
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:57,574
but of course they required a lot of memory ah
and we thought we could do better

263
00:20:57,575 --> 00:21:03,075
and so Steve signed a deal with us to actually provide
bundled applications for the first Mac

264
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:07,576
and so we were big believers in the Mac
and what Steve was doing there.

265
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:13,577
Most people don't remember, but until the Mac,
Microsoft was not in the applications business...

266
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:15,078
it was dominated by Lotus.

267
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,079
And Microsoft took a big gamble to write for the Mac.

268
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,580
And so we got started in early 1982

269
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:28,581
on our Macintosh software effort and
I think at that point in time you know,

270
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:34,082
it really clicked with Bill that you know, graphic user interface
was going to be the way, the way of the future.

271
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,583
But while Bill was having his own GUI revelation,

272
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:42,084
Jobs believed that Apple's true enemy was IBM.

273
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:47,085
Will Big Blue dominate the entire computer industry...

274
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:51,086
the entire information age,

275
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:55,587
was George Orwell right about 1984?

276
00:21:56,588 --> 00:22:01,588
Despite Steve Jobs' showmanship,
the IBM PC was hurting Apple's business.

277
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,589
And most pundits considered that...

278
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,590
Apple was going to be
out of business in a few short months.

279
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:12,591
Business Week ran an article on their cover saying

280
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,592
ehm "It's Over - IBM Has Won."

281
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:20,593
The Mac team saw themselves as Apple's pirates

282
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,594
but the gang was now being called on to save the ship,

283
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:26,595
as the Apple II was losing precious market share.

284
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,096
In the case of the Macintosh team,

285
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:33,597
they were behind schedule in getting the Mac out

286
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:36,598
which was not unusual in high technology

287
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,099
and so just getting that product to market
was extremely important.

288
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,500
After many delays, a date for
the launch of the Mac was announced.

289
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:54,501
The pressure of the deadline was mounting,
but Steve was still a perfectionist.

290
00:22:55,002 --> 00:23:00,502
No design issue was too small and
it was never too late to do it right.

291
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:04,503
It was a pressure cooker.
We were working until we finished.

292
00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:09,004
We couldn't go to sleep or anything
I was up for three days in that very last push

293
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:16,005
and finally the stars aligned and the last release
we made at six a.m. that morning.

294
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:28,506
It was now all or nothing,
because Lisa had turned out an expensive flop.

295
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,007
The fate of the whole company
seemed to rest on the launch of the Mac.

296
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:37,008
John Sculley had even authorised a
15 million dollar advertising campaign

297
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:39,009
to coincide with the Mac's public unveiling

298
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,010
January 24th, 1984.

299
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:49,011
I remember how nervous Steve was
before the introduction of the Macintosh

300
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:53,512
and the rehearsal the night before was a total disaster

301
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:57,513
nothing seemed to go right,
Steve was upset at everybody,

302
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:01,514
we wondered how in the world we were going to
get through the introduction the following day

303
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:06,515
but when that moment came
Steve was a master showman.

304
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:15,016
There have only been two milestone products in our industry

305
00:24:16,517 --> 00:24:23,017
the Apple 2 in 1977 and the IBM PC in 1981.

306
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:25,518
Today...one year after LISA

307
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,019
we are introducing the third industry milestone product
...Macintosh.

308
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,520
Many of us have been working on
Macintosh for over two years now

309
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:41,521
and it has turned out insanely great.

310
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:49,022
You've just seen some pictures of Macintosh
now I'd like to show you Macintosh in person.

311
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:16,023
The Macintosh was undoubtedly the first affordable
personal computer with a genuine graphical user interface.

312
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:20,024
It was also the first computer to be
a monument to one man's ego.

313
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:26,025
Forget the brilliant work done at Xerox PARC
and the innovations borrowed from the Lisa.

314
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:30,526
On the day only one man was claiming paternity for the Mac.

315
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:34,527
Computer generated voice:
So it is with considerable pride, that I introduce a man

316
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:38,528
who's been like a father to me - Steve Jobs.

317
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:47,529
I was standing off-stage and as he came off

318
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,030
he said this is the proudest happiest moment
of my life and it was all over his face

319
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:56,031
it clearly was cause he had launched a revolution.

320
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:05,532
Ultimately it comes down to taste.

321
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:11,533
It comes down to trying to expose yourself to
the best things that humans have done

322
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:16,034
and then try to bring those things in to what you're doing.

323
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:20,535
I mean Picasso had a saying he said
good artists copy great artists steal.

324
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:27,036
And we have always been shameless
about stealing great ideas

325
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:34,537
and I think part of what made the Macintosh
great was that the people working on it

326
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:41,538
were musicians and poets and artists
and zoologists and historians

327
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:44,539
who also happened to be the best
computer scientists in the world.

328
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,540
With delusions of grandeur running rampant,

329
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,541
Apple created a Hollywood-style TV commercial.

330
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:55,042
It symbolised how the friendly Mac would free us

331
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:58,543
from the Orwellian tyranny of clunky IBM PC's.

332
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:01,544
Pleeeeeease!

333
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:10,545
Despite the hype, by late 1984,
the Mac's sales were disastrous.

334
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:28,546
In ad after ad, Apple desperately pointed out
that the Mac was far easier to use than the IBM PC.

335
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:33,047
But it sold for $2500
a thousand more than the IBM.

336
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:40,548
And despite Jobs' best efforts in recruiting
software makers like Bill Gates, applications were scarce.

337
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,049
It didn't do very much.

338
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,550
We had Mac Paint and Mac Write
were our only applications

339
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:50,051
and the market started to figure this out,

340
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:58,552
by the end of the year people said
well maybe the IBM PC isn't as easy to use

341
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:03,553
or is not as attractive as the Macintosh but
it actually does something that we want to be able to do

342
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:06,054
spreadsheets, wordprocessing and database

343
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:11,055
and so we started to see the sales of the Mac
tail off towards the end of 1984,

344
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:15,056
and that became a problem the following year.

345
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:21,057
Cringely's Third Law of Personal Computing was right again,

346
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:27,058
to succeed, a PC must have an application
which alone justifies buying the whole box.

347
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,559
The IBM PC had Lotus 1-2-3.
The Mac needed its killer application.

348
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,060
WYSIWYG - another bunch of initials,
from the world of the nerds.

349
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:42,561
What you see is what you get
so what's the big deal?

350
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:49,562
Well, it turns out that it's very hard to print on paper
exactly the same image that you see on the computer screen.

351
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:54,563
Eighty per cent of our brain is devoted to processing
visual data, but that's not the same for computers.

352
00:28:54,564 --> 00:28:57,064
I've been here writing a letter to my Mum

353
00:28:57,065 --> 00:29:04,365
and I'm signing it Bob in 72 point
Times Roman Italic type as befitting myself

354
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:07,866
and when I tell it to print,
what comes out is a Bob

355
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:10,367
but certainly not the Bob that I intended.

356
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:17,068
Until someone invented a way to print
exactly what was on the screen

357
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,569
gui would be, well a lot of hooey.

358
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,570
Apple's problem was the dot matrix printer.

359
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:26,071
It gave everything a type-writer quality.

360
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:32,072
But salvation was at hand and
once again it owed a lot to Xerox Parc.

361
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:35,073
One of Parc's former brains, John Warnock,

362
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:39,074
had invented a technology that allowed
a laser printer to print exactly,

363
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:41,575
precisely what was on your screen.

364
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:46,076
He started a company called Adobe
to market his invention

365
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,577
And what we had figured out how to do

366
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:52,078
that no-one else had figured out
how to do was drive laser printers.

367
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,079
Within two or three weeks
we had cancelled our internal project,

368
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,580
a bunch of people wanted to
kill me over this, but we did it

369
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:02,581
and I had cut a deal with Adobe user software

370
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:05,582
and we bought 19.9 per cent of Adobe at Apple.

371
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,083
The investment paid off.

372
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:26,584
The power of precise laser-printed images
and a user friendly gui gave birth to a brand new business

373
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:28,585
Desk-top publishing (DTP).

374
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:32,586
The spreadsheet had made us all accountants.

375
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:36,087
Now using break-through software
we could create fancy artwork,

376
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:39,588
snappy-looking note-paper, even counterfeit money.

377
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,089
The Mac had found its killer application

378
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:48,090
and would soon become the PC of choice
for any creative business.

379
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:54,591
It changed my life that one instant
when I picked up the mouse

380
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:58,592
my whole life changed to building
a career as a computer artist.

381
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:06,593
The success of desk-top publishing
came too late for Apple's founder.

382
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:11,594
In 1985 Mac sales were still flat
but Jobs refused to believe the numbers.

383
00:31:11,595 --> 00:31:15,095
He simply behaved as if the Mac was
a hot seller from the start.

384
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:19,096
The grandiose plans of what
Macintosh were going to be

385
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:24,097
was just so far out of whack
with the truth of what the product was doing

386
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:28,098
and the truth of what the product was doing
was not horrible it was salvagable

387
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:31,599
but the gap between the two
was just so unthinkable

388
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,100
that somebody had to do something
and that somebody was John Sculley.

389
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:39,101
John Sculley, whom Jobs saw
as his own creation,

390
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:42,102
presented the board with
his strategy to save the company.

391
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:45,503
The plan did not include Steve Jobs.

392
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:51,004
The board had to make a choice,
and I said look, it's Steve's company,

393
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:56,505
I was brought in here to help you know,
if you want him to run it that's fine with me

394
00:31:57,506 --> 00:32:02,006
but you know we've at least decide what
we're going to do and everyone has got to get behind it.

395
00:32:02,507 --> 00:32:08,507
But he took it as a personal attack,
started attacking Scully in which you know,

396
00:32:08,508 --> 00:32:13,008
backed himself into a corner because he was sure
that the board would support him and not Sculley.

397
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:18,509
And ehm ultimately after the board talked
with Steve and talked with me,

398
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:25,010
the decision was that we would go forward
with my plans and Steve left.

399
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:32,511
What can I say? I hired the wrong guy.

400
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,012
That was Sculley?

401
00:32:34,013 --> 00:32:41,013
Yeah and eh he destroyed everything
I spent ten years working for.

402
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:46,014
Starting with me but that wasn't the saddest part.

403
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:51,015
I would have gladly left Apple if
Apple would have turned out like I wanted it to.

404
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:54,516
People in the company had
very mixed feelings about it.

405
00:32:54,517 --> 00:33:00,017
Everyone had been terrorised by Steve Jobs
at some point or another and so there was a certain relief

406
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:05,018
that the terrorist will be gone
but on the other hand I think

407
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:08,019
there was an incredible respect
for Steve Jobs by the very same people

408
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
and we were all very worried
what would happen to this company

409
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:14,521
without the visionary, without the founder,
without the care, without the charisma...

410
00:33:15,022 --> 00:33:17,522
Apple never recovered from losing Steve.

411
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:20,023
Steve was the heart and soul and driving force.

412
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:25,024
It would be quite a different place today.
They lost their soul.

413
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:41,025
The years after Jobs left were the most
profitable for Apple Computers.

414
00:33:41,526 --> 00:33:44,026
Apple people worked hard, they played hard.

415
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:46,527
They made the computer business
look like a beach party

416
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:50,028
and with a median age of twenty seven
the company was very sexy too...

417
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,529
...maybe too sexy.

418
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,030
There was so much sleeping around that
they came up with a travel policy back then

419
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:58,031
that men would share rooms with other men on the road
and women with other women

420
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:00,032
just to settle it down a bit.

421
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:03,533
They applied the California lifestyle
to the computer industry

422
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:06,034
and the computer industry
would never be the same again.

423
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:14,535
In this bizarre promo to inspire their sales force,

424
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:20,536
Apple stressed that the Mac's ease of use could
liberate the pathetic prisoners of the IBM PC.

425
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:28,537
Commercial:
We'll fight them in the office and the classroom
and the desktop with superior weapons.

426
00:34:28,538 --> 00:34:32,038
With improvements to the hardware
and the boom in desktop publishing,

427
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,539
Mac production went into overdrive.

428
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,540
By 1987, Apple was selling a million a year. IBM numbers!

429
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:51,041
The Mac minted money,
half its 2000 dollar price was pure profit!

430
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:04,542
Apple arrogantly assumed their stuff was so good,

431
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:09,043
consumers would always pay a premium for it.
Big mistake.

432
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:14,544
The Mac really ought to have
won the battle for the desktop

433
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:18,045
OK, it was more expensive than an IBM PC

434
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:22,546
but if what you wanted was a friendly
easy to use system and surely everyone wanted that,

435
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:27,047
then this was the only game in town
at least that's what the boys at Apple thought

436
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:30,048
but they weren't reckoning on one man, Bill Gates.

437
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:36,049
Gates saw that the Mac's GUI represented
a long term threat to Microsoft's money machine,

438
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,550
to DOS, the clunky operating system
that sat inside every IBM PC.

439
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:44,551
So Bill had his boys create a GUI
that sat in top of DOS

440
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:48,052
rather like building a fancy facade
on an old building.

441
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:51,053
They called it Windows and
it wasn't much at first

442
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:54,054
but it was good enough to
defend the DOS franchise.

443
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:57,055
February or March of 1984,

444
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,556
which was just right after the
Apple Macintosh had been introduced.

445
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:07,557
And at that point in time we were firmly convinced
that we needed to bet on graphic user interface.

446
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:10,558
First with the Macintosh
and then with Windows.

447
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:16,559
At Microsoft, it was a long and
often frustrating struggle

448
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,560
to find a GUI solution
that challenged the MAC.

449
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,561
I know the feeling!

450
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:33,062
For years teams of Microsofties slaved in
their windowless offices to build Windows

451
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:37,063
refreshed by an endless supply of free sodas.

452
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:44,564
I was the development manager for Windows 1.0
and we kept slogging and slogging

453
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:47,065
yeah it took us i don't know about seven versions

454
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:50,566
just a few versions to get
things right for 1990, that's right.

455
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:54,567
Windows may at first have been
a joke compared to the Mac.

456
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:58,068
But Gates is persistent. Slowly it got better.

457
00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:00,569
And the guys at Apple got worried.

458
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,070
As each new feature appeared on the Windows gui,

459
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:06,571
the more they thought Microsoft
was copying the features on the Mac.

460
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:10,572
So finally they sued Microsoft,

461
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:15,573
accusing them in a long legal battle of
stealing the look and feel of Apple's GUI.

462
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:20,074
The look and feel which is how it looks,

463
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:26,575
the experience of using it was not patentable
but it was copyrightable

464
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:30,576
but there was no precedent law.
This was going to be a precedent setting case.

465
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:35,577
But it was a period of five years where, Microsoft

466
00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:41,578
our whole strategy would have been ruined
because Windows was very important to us.

467
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,079
They weren't going to change anything and

468
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
they were going to get us to cave in

469
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:52,581
or take us all the way to
the Supreme Court on this thing.

470
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:59,082
We assumed that the lawyers, the judges would all
come to the right conclusion which eventually they did.

471
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,083
And Apple lost.

472
00:38:01,084 --> 00:38:08,084
But in that period of about six years
that this case was going on

473
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:13,585
it may have lulled us into a
bit of complacency thinking that

474
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:18,086
we were going to be insulated,
you know, from the Windows attack.

475
00:38:24,587 --> 00:38:28,587
The launch of Windows 3 in 1990
killed off Apple's hopes

476
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:31,088
that the Macintosh would win the gui wars.

477
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:40,589
Today we're introducing Microsoft Windows version 3...

478
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:46,090
The six years' labour to produce a GUI
that made IBM PCs and all the clones

479
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:49,591
as easy to use as the Mac finally came up trumps.

480
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:56,592
In a year Windows 3 sold close to 30 million copies,
consigning the Mac to a niche in the market.

481
00:38:56,593 --> 00:38:59,593
Ladies and gentlemen the Windows 3 development team.

482
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,594
Bill Gates strategy won out.

483
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:09,095
At every stage in the PC's development
he joined the leading hardware company

484
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:15,096
and by carving out a dominant market share
for his product made his software the industry standard.

485
00:39:15,597 --> 00:39:22,597
You know the original PC did our evangelism in the way
we created tools for that and pulled that together.

486
00:39:23,098 --> 00:39:26,598
Take Windows did we bet our company on that
did that come together?

487
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:30,599
Virtually everything we've done,
when we've first come out with it there's a lot of scepticism

488
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
but most of the things we really stuck with them

489
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:39,001
and despite all that second guessing
we were able to pull them off.

490
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,002
The problem was the industry wasn't measured by

491
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:46,503
who has the best selling personal computer
or who has the most innovative technology.

492
00:39:46,504 --> 00:39:53,504
The industry was measured by who had the most open system
that was adopted by the most other companies

493
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:58,505
and the Microsoft strategy ultimately turned out
to be the better business strategy.

494
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:02,506
The only problem with Microsoft is
they just have no taste,

495
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:05,507
they have absolutely no taste,
and what that means is

496
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:08,508
I don't mean that in a small way
I mean that in a big way.

497
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,509
In the sense that...

498
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:22,010
they, they don't think of original ideas and
they don't bring much culture into their product

499
00:40:23,511 --> 00:40:25,011
and you say why is that important

500
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:29,012
well you know proportionally spaced fonts
come from type setting and beautiful books,

501
00:40:29,013 --> 00:40:31,013
that's where one gets the idea

502
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:34,014
if it weren't for the Mac
they would never have that in their products

503
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:41,515
and so I guess I am saddened,

504
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:44,516
Not by Microsoft's success
I have no problem with their success,

505
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:48,517
they've earned their success for the most part.

506
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:52,518
I have a problem with the fact that
they just make really third rate products.

507
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:59,019
I will admit quite frankly that I think
Windows today is probably four years behind,

508
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:05,520
three years behind where it would have been
had we not danced with IBM for so long.

509
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:10,521
Because the amount of split energy,
split works, split IQ in the company

510
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:15,522
really cost our end customer
real innovation in our product line

511
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:21,523
and so whenever I hear these criticisms
which I gotta to say sting eh sometimes,

512
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:26,524
I say to myself just you watch,
just you watch Windows 95, Windows 9...

513
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:30,525
there's no lack of focus there hasn't been here
for the last three or four years

514
00:41:30,526 --> 00:41:33,026
since we didn't have this big spot with IBM.

515
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:36,527
And i think even in the operating systems here now,

516
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:42,028
you'll start to see clear, clear...
and people will recognise clear leadership.

517
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:44,029
We just keep making them better.

518
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:49,030
We get millions of phone calls
we get to go out there and talk to customers

519
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:54,531
there's nothing cast in concrete. If people decide
there's something we should change we change it,

520
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:57,532
it's a lot better than most industries in that sense.

521
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:03,033
I think the way that applications user interfaces
have advanced over the last decade

522
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:08,034
Microsoft has been at the forefront
of a very high percentage of that,

523
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:11,035
and you know,
I think it's great stuff.

524
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:19,536
On August 24th 1995, Gates delivered
the coup de grace to his software rivals.

525
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:26,037
Windows 95 combines a PC's operating system
and its graphical interface into one package.

526
00:42:26,038 --> 00:42:33,038
With a worldwide promotional campaign costing $300 million,
it looks set to become the industry standard

527
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,539
supplanting Microsoft's old warhorse DOS.

528
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
Cue the triumph of Bill.

529
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:46,041
A software nerd is the richest man in the world.

530
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:53,042
But even as Bill Gates bestrides
the PC world like a colossus,

531
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:57,543
ahead lie bigger battles, battles
that will make the trouncing of the Mac

532
00:42:57,544 --> 00:43:01,044
and mastering the IBM PC
look like a tea party.

533
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:12,045
The Gates fortune was built on setting the
industry standard for PC operating systems.

534
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:15,546
Fine as long as PC's are
stand alone boxes on your desk.

535
00:43:18,047 --> 00:43:24,547
But now they are being linked into a worldwide network,
the much hyped information superhighway.

536
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:28,548
The PC on the internet is a mailbox,
a telephone and a television.

537
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:36,049
Of course at the centre of this will be the idea of
digital convergence that is taking all the information

538
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:44,050
books, art, movies and being able to provide that
on demand on what the PC will have evolved into.

539
00:43:44,551 --> 00:43:50,551
The Internet is the next wave of the information revolution
where there is as yet no industry standard,

540
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:53,552
a world where even Bill Gates seems unsure.

541
00:43:54,053 --> 00:43:57,053
You know, if you take the way
the Internet is changing month by month,

542
00:43:57,054 --> 00:44:00,554
if somebody can predict what's going to happen
three months from now, nine months from now

543
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,555
even today eh my hat's off to them,

544
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:10,056
I think we've got a phenomena here that is moving
so rapidly that nobody knows exactly where it will go.

545
00:44:13,557 --> 00:44:16,057
Bill Gates isn't resting on his laurels.

546
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:21,558
He's making new alliances, like investing in
Steven Spielberg's new movie studio, Dreamworks.

547
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:31,559
He's in cable TV with broadcaster NBC and in
competition with Rupert Murdoch and Mickey Mouse.

548
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,560
These tycoons are a far cry from
the nerds Bill has so far outsmarted

549
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:41,061
guys like Gary Kildall who became
businessmen by accident.

550
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:48,562
Even Bill's victory over IBM was really with a corporate outpost
a long way from the attention of Big Blue Headquarters.

551
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:55,563
No - Bill's new rivals are hotshots, not hippies.

552
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:58,064
And one of them is the guy I'm visiting.

553
00:44:58,065 --> 00:45:02,065
He hopes the Internet will go somewhere
other than to Bill Gates' bottom line.

554
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:08,566
He's betting it will soon consign the PC itself
to the trashcan and do the same to Microsoft.

555
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:22,067
Larry Ellison is the boss of Oracle,

556
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:27,568
a booming business that sells software to companies
who share information among hundreds of users.

557
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:33,069
In Atherton, the most exclusive suburb in Silicon Valley,

558
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:38,570
the bachelor billionaire has built himself
a 10 million dollar samurai mansion. Naturally!

559
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:44,571
I want to have a large pond about 5 acres of water
surrounded by several little buildings like a village.

560
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:50,072
With his ceremonial carp Larry contemplates
the coming battle with Microsoft.

561
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:55,073
People make a terrible mistake of thinking
IBM is the present and Microsoft is the future

562
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:58,074
I think IBM is the past and Microsoft is the present

563
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:02,075
and the future has not happened so we don't know what company,
what technology is going to be dominant.

564
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:06,076
These are temple guardians from the Koma Kura period

565
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:10,577
and, they you know you would have
one on either side of your door and,

566
00:46:10,578 --> 00:46:15,078
the job was to scare employees of Microsoft away
and keep them from entering the Temple.

567
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,579
We shouldn't spend all of our time wringing our hands
about Microsoft you know

568
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,580
Microsoft world domination that eh
there still room enough for innovation.

569
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:29,581
there's going to be change and
Microsoft's future is not assured.

570
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:32,082
Anything good for the Internet.

571
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:36,083
Yeah I'm very supportive of it because
the Internet does not require a PC.

572
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:41,084
Larry believes the PC will be replaced with
a cheap device he calls an information appliance.

573
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:45,585
It will be a glorified television which will
access information and computing

574
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:49,086
simply by connecting to
giant computers via the Internet.

575
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,087
Just like turning on a tap.

576
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:54,088
and the PC will go the way of the well and the bucket.

577
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:57,089
I hate the PC with a passion.

578
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:00,090
Me going down to the store
and buying Windows 95,

579
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:06,091
I've got to get into my car drive down
to a store, buy a cardboard box full of bits,

580
00:47:06,092 --> 00:47:11,592
you know encoded on a piece of plastic CDROM
and you bring it home and read a manual install this thing

581
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:15,593
you must be kidding you know,
put the stuff on the net

582
00:47:15,594 --> 00:47:20,594
it's bits, don't put bits in cardboard,
cardboard in trucks, trucks to stores,

583
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:25,095
me go to the store, you know,
pick the stuff out, it's insane.

584
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:32,096
OK I love the Internet,
I want information you know it flows across the wire.

585
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:38,597
So, the way ahead is wired,
Larry, Bill, everybody agrees on that.

586
00:47:38,598 --> 00:47:42,098
And we have the nerds of the seventies
to thank for making it possible,

587
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,599
whether the PC itself survives or not.

588
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,100
As we take up their challenge, it's worth finding out
how these pioneers made out.

589
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:54,501
Steve Jobs sold all his Apple stock
in disgust when he was fired,

590
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:58,502
but has made another fortune from
his stake in a movie animation studio.

591
00:47:58,503 --> 00:48:01,503
He has no doubts about
his contribution to humanity.

592
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:06,004
If you talk to people that use
the Macintosh they love it

593
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:11,005
but you don't hear people loving products
very often you know really,

594
00:48:11,006 --> 00:48:14,506
but you could feel it in there,
there was something really wonderful there.

595
00:48:16,007 --> 00:48:21,007
Apple, the company Jobs took from a garage
to the Fortune 500 is in trouble.

596
00:48:21,008 --> 00:48:24,008
It is now a fading force in the PC marketplace.

597
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:29,009
Apple's other millionaire founder Steve Wozniak,

598
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:33,010
spends much of his time teaching
computing to 11 and 12 year olds.

599
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:42,011
IBM created the mass market for the PC
but no longer sets industry standards.

600
00:48:44,012 --> 00:48:48,512
And most of the guys who built
IBM's first PC have left Big Blue.

601
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:54,013
And Ed Roberts who built the Altair,
the very first PC,

602
00:48:56,514 --> 00:49:01,014
he turned his back on computing
and returned to his first love, medicine.

603
00:49:03,015 --> 00:49:05,015
Funny, isn't how things turn out?

604
00:49:06,016 --> 00:49:09,516
After all the first PC revolution
caught us all pretty much by surprise.

605
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:13,517
Even Microsoft with 2000 millionaires
and at least two billionaires

606
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:16,518
never expected to be as successful
as they are today.

607
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:20,019
Cringely's universal law says,

608
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:26,020
Society takes 30 years to adopt new technology
into daily life, the phone, movies.

609
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:30,521
Even television took that long before
our rear ends became couch-shaped.

610
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:33,022
So far the PC has had 20 years.

611
00:49:33,523 --> 00:49:36,523
So what comes next? Well, I'm off to find out.

612
00:49:36,524 --> 00:49:38,524
See you in ten years!
