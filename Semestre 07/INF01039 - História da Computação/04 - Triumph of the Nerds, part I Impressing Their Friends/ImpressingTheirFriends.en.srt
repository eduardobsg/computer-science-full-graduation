00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:18,701
Hi, I'm Bob Cringely - and I'm here to tell you the incredible story
of how personal computers took over the world.

2
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:25,576
Why am I telling you this at a basketball game? Well, I like
the game - but mainly it's because of that guy down there.

3
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:37,513
His name is Paul Allen and everything you see here belongs to him
-- the Portland Trailblazer's basketball team, their arena,

4
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:39,104
even the dancers.

5
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,997
Thanks to personal computers, he has $8 billion to spend
on such toys.

6
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:53,216
Twenty years ago Allen and his high school friend, Bill Gates,
 were running a two-man software company called Microsoft.

7
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,560
Today Allen is richer than God and Gates is richer than Allen.

8
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,004
Twenty years ago, young men like Paul Allen and Bill Gates 
invented the personal computer

9
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:10,886
and in doing so launched a revolution that's changed the way
we live, work and communicate.

10
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,877
It's hard to believe that twenty years ago there were 
no personal computers,

11
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:19,137
now it's the third largest industry in the world, somewhere
between energy production and illegal drugs

12
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:27,181
but the most amazing thing of all is that it happened by accident
because a bunch of disenfranchised nerds wanted to
impress their friends.

13
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:08,021
This is the story of how a handful of guys launched an
industrial revolution.

14
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:12,628
How they changed the culture of business, how they made history.

15
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:18,678
I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in Silicon Valley,

16
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:25,416
at exactly the right time historically where this invention has,
has taken form.

17
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:30,917
It wasn't like we both thought it was going to go a long ways,
it was like, we'll both do it for fun

18
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:36,039
and even though we're goin' to lose some money probably
we'll just have been able to say we had a company.

19
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:42,915
Now all of us would get together and just hope we were right
that the PC would become a big thing.

20
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:51,131
You know I stop and say wow the PC really has become part of the
very fabric of the way people live

21
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:56,322
and we certainly surged with it. I used to stop and say
hmmm pretty incredible ride.

22
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,948
Most of these people come from the place I call home,

23
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:09,042
the Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco, California.

24
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:12,926
Growing-up here near the electronics companies
that give the place its name,

25
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:19,320
these founders of the PC revolution were for the most part
middle class white kids from good suburban homes.

26
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,530
But it's not their homes we're interested in -- it's their garages.

27
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,762
This is my garage and this is all my junk.

28
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:42,388
I'm probably one of the few guys in Silicon Valley who
actually has room in his garage for a car, 
most everyone else seems to use theirs to start 
computer companies and create great fortunes,

29
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:52,460
but I don't have a fortune - I'm a failure, I've written
computer programmes that almost ran and I've designed 
and built hardware devices that frankly didn't work at all

30
00:03:52,495 --> 00:04:00,870
but I'm the ideal guy to tell the story of the personal computer
business because I'm its premier gossip columnist and 
everyone tells me all their secrets.

31
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,130
And this is my home where I write a gossip column for a
computing magazine.

32
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,130
Sorry about the mess.

33
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:16,731
Institutions in constant change like the PC industry are driven
by rumor and gossip and I thrive on both.

34
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:24,480
My electronic mail address is deluged with inside information
about everything from product flaws to who's sleeping with whom.

35
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,020
What ties these gossipers together is a desire for truth.

36
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,360
These people and their love of technology have fueled 
the PC revolution.

37
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,250
To understand them is to understand that revolution.

38
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,250
So let's go find some.

39
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,910
Meet Edwin Chin on a Saturday morning at the Weird Stuff Warehouse.

40
00:04:55,165 --> 00:05:00,940
This could be 1976 or 1996 because there is always a new
generation of techies like Edwin

41
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:04,378
who hear the calling. Most other kids are watching TV,

42
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:05,650
but not Edwin.

43
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:14,176
You know I've been interested in electronics and technology 
as a hobby since I started when I was like six or seven you know.

44
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:17,350
How old are you now, Edwin?
- Ten, right now.

45
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,500
It's no coincidence that the only woman in the vicinity looks bored,

46
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:32,499
because this is a boy thing -- the obsession of a particular type
of boy who would rather struggle with an electronic box than
with a world of unpredictable people.

47
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,790
We call them engineers, programmers, hackers, and techies,

48
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,200
but mainly we call them nerds.

49
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:45,425
I think a nerd is a person who uses the telephone 
to talk to other people about telephones.

50
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,970
And a computer nerd therefore is somebody who uses
a computer in order to use a computer.

51
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:58,420
And people have different degrees of passion and different 
types of passion.

52
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:04,883
Some people like just live databases, like 5th normal form is just
like nirvana, they just quest for it you know,

53
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,940
that's like what gets them up in the morning.

54
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,410
What do your friends think of you?

55
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,852
Boy, he's a nerd.

56
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:20,110
but I don't mind, I'm used to being called a nerd,

57
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,240
can't have other people stop your dreams.

58
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:29,360
And in Silicon Valley the dream is to grow up to become
a boy like this...

59
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:36,010
Graham Spencer is chief programmer for Architext Software

60
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:43,720
six guys who graduated from Stanford University and started
a company just because they like each other.

61
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,670
This is a modern-day startup, but at heart it's no different from
PC pioneers like Apple, or Microsoft,

62
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:53,630
nerds who share a dream.

63
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,036
Their hobby is their business

64
00:06:56,036 --> 00:07:01,070
and the culture they've created is identical to that of a
thousand other technology companies.

65
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:10,200
First, they dumped the idea of nine to five. In this industry,
you can work any 80 hours per week you like.

66
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:15,975
...my cap which I use to cover my eyes and sleep in
the early morning while everybody is coming in.

67
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:21,338
We didn't even obey a 24 hour clock, we'd come in and
programme for a couple of days straight.

68
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:28,214
We'd - you know, four or five of us, when it was time to eat
we'd all get in our cars, kind of race over to the restaurant

69
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:30,758
and sit and talk about what we were doing, sometimes I'd get...

70
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:34,471
...excited talking about things, I'd forget to eat,
but then you know, we'd just go back

71
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:38,940
and programme some more. It was us and our friends - 
those were fun days.

72
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:57,160
Let's look in the refrigerator... Woah! We have
coke and cold pizza.

73
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,810
I drink about two litres of coke a day.

74
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,416
Two litres of coke a day and do you like think of it as brain food?

75
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:08,298
It keeps me going you know, that and listening to heavy metal,
and get caffeinated and hack.

76
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:18,749
I'd sit down in my room on the floor with sheets of paper spread
 all around with my computer design I was working on.

77
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:24,318
And always I noticed that I was up pretty late at night and I had
lots of cokes - it's just part of that life.

78
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:34,081
A combination of stale pizza and body odour and spilt cola
kinda ground in to the rug.

79
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:42,130
I brought some spaghetti to work and then forgot to wash out the
container for the last couple of days, maybe six or seven...

80
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,457
if I had to be honest. Ooh, that smells bad.

81
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:53,406
Eating, bathing, having a girlfriend, having an active social life

82
00:08:53,406 --> 00:09:00,365
is incidental, it gets in the way of code time. Writing code
is the primary force that drives our lives so

83
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:04,540
anything that interrupts that is is wasteful.

84
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:12,000
What is it about the internal logic of a computer
that's so enticing?

85
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:15,609
For one thing, such logic CAN be understood,

86
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:20,580
as opposed to things that can't be understood at all,
like the motivations of young women, say,

87
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,170
or of the French.

88
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,827
Let me explain...

89
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,110
Time for the Cringely crash course in basic computers,
Part 1.

90
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,985
This is a mainframe computer,

91
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:35,757
all of these cabinets are one machine. In the old days
all computers were this size

92
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:37,945
they were tended by engineers in white coats

93
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,060
a kind of priesthood who took their jobs very seriously.

94
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:46,163
Now all computers work pretty much the same, whether
 it's a giant that serves two thousand users like this one,

95
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:48,748
or a little notebook that serves only me.

96
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:52,725
They process numerical data - adding, multiplying,
comparing,

97
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,906
the fact is if you can quantify it a computer can handle it.

98
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:58,888
It's the emotional stuff they don't know what to do with.

99
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:04,640
The data must be put into a special binary code
consisting only of ones and zeros.

100
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,023
And you have to give the computer instructions, also
in code, to tell it exactly what to do wth the data

101
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:14,199
and in what order. These instructions are called a program.

102
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,633
In the early days, you put in the instructions by
flipping switches or loaded them from paper tape.

103
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:22,086
This was called machine language.

104
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:24,339
It made computers a pain to use.

105
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:28,713
Even worse, every type of computer spoke a different
machine language.

106
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:33,910
The ENIAC could compute the thirty second trajectory
of a shell in twenty seconds.

107
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:38,059
Operators required two days to program it do so.

108
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:43,030
Then a US Navy captain named Grace Hopper 
solved the problem.

109
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,970
She invented a computer language, English words that
the computer itself could translate into binary code.

110
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:53,501
Now users could type whole lists of instructions
into a computer

111
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,755
rather than flipping those damned switches.

112
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,690
Like most things having to do with computers,
that first language had a silly name - COBOL.

113
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,498
It was followed by other languages like FORTRAN and BASIC
and they all made computing just a bit more user-friendly.

114
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,650
So when some nerd tells you he's been up all night
programming or writing software or hacking code,

115
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,904
what he really means is he's been typing long lists of
instructions into his computer.

116
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:22,796
Mainframe computers were far from personal. They sat
in big air-conditioned rooms

117
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:25,381
 at insurance companies, phone companies, and the bank,

118
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,623
and their main function was to get us confused with
some other guy named Cringely,

119
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:32,009
who was a deadbeat and had a criminal record.

120
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:36,715
Eventually computer terminals did begin to
appear in some schools,

121
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,637
but most of us paid no attention.

122
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:45,464
But there was usually one kid who did pay attention, 
falling in love with the digital purity of those ones and zeros.

123
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,253
He was the nerd.

124
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,650
And I took this book home that described the PDP 8 computer
and it just...oh, it was just like a bible to me.

125
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:58,470
I mean, all these things that for some reason I'd fallen
in love with, like you might fall in love with...

126
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,431
a card game called Magic, or you might fall in love with doing
crossword puzzles or something else,

127
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,932
or playing a musical instrument, I fell in love with these
little descriptions of computers on their insides,

128
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:11,975
and it was a little mathematics, I could work out some
problems on paper and solve it and see how it's done,

129
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:16,084
and I could come up with my own solutions 
and feel good inside.

130
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,712
So you would keyboard these commands in and then you
would wait for a while and then the thing would go dadadada...

131
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:24,170
and it would tell you something out,

132
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,870
but even with that it was still remarkable - especially for 
a ten year old,

133
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:41,005
that you could write a programme in Basic let's say or Fortran
and actually this machine would sort of take your idea

134
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:47,632
and it would sort of execute your idea and
give you back some results

135
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,206
and if they were the results that you predicted your program
really worked it was an incredibly thrilling experience.

136
00:12:54,061 --> 00:13:00,159
 Nerds wanted their own computers right from the beginning,
but it took a technological breakthrough to make that possible.

137
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:07,648
This is it, the chip, the microprocessor, this is what allows you
to have a mainframe computer on your desk.

138
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:13,415
In the 1950s mainframes were as big as this garage and that's
because they were filled with thousands of these,

139
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:15,535
vacuum tubes or valves.

140
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:19,645
Eventually the valves were made much smaller and 
replaced with transistors,

141
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,910
still too big however to make a computer that could fit 
on your desk.

142
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:29,122
What that took was further miniaturisation. Here we have a single
piece of silicon etched with thousands of transistors.

143
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:34,690
This microprocessor holds more than a million transistors and
that's the secret of the personal computer

144
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:38,203
and that's why they call it silicon valley not computer valley.

145
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:46,023
These are the people who invented the microprocessor -- Intel.

146
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:53,712
Intel was started 28 years ago by a handful of guys after a row
 with their old boss.

147
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:58,616
Their microprocessors today power 85 percent 
of the world's computers.

148
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:06,967
Intel not only invented the chip, they are responsible for the
laid-back Silicon Valley working style.

149
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:09,486
Everyone was on a first-name basis.

150
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:13,463
There were no reserved parking places, no offices, only cubicles.

151
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:17,439
It's still true today. Here's the chairman's cubicle.

152
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:21,416
Knock, knock I knocked at the door but there's no door.

153
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:28,441
Gordon Moore is one of the Intel founders worth $3 billion.
With money like that, I'd have a door.

154
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:34,473
In a business like this the people with the power are the ones 
that have the understanding of what's going on,

155
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,140
not necessarily the ones on top.

156
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:41,366
And it's very important that those people that have the knowledge
are the ones that make the decisions.

157
00:14:41,962 --> 00:14:48,126
So we set up something where everyone who had the knowledge
had an equal say in what was going on.

158
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:56,344
Intel's microprocessors kept getting more powerful. 
They soon had enough horsepower to run a whole computer.

159
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,791
Only Intel didn't appreciate the brilliance of their own product,

160
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,850
seeing it as useful mainly for powering calculators 
or traffic lights.

161
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:10,859
Intel had all the elements necessary to invent the PC business,
but they just didn't get it.

162
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:14,041
Lucky for us, someone did.

163
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:20,271
This is the chip that launched the personal computer revolution.

164
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:29,417
This is the magazine that announced it.

165
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:38,100
In January 1975 featured on the cover was the world's first 
personal computer the Altair 8800.

166
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,402
It was the crazy idea of an ex-airforce officer from Georgia:
Ed Roberts.

167
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:50,162
If you look at it you know it was kind of grandiose
almost megalomaniac kind of scheme you know

168
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:55,663
and right now I couldn't do it because I could see right off
there's no way you could do this.

169
00:15:57,188 --> 00:16:02,888
But at that time you know we just lacked the eh the benefits
of age and experience.

170
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:04,412
We didn't know we couldn't do it.

171
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:13,956
20 years after Ed Roberts' flash of brilliance, this exhibit is being
held to celebrate the anniversary of the Altair.

172
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,385
Like every other PC pioneer, Ed built his computer just because
he wanted one to play with.

173
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,428
There were some of us that lusted after computers
really at that time.

174
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,140
All the computers in the world tended to be in big centres

175
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:34,436
and you had to get permission to get close to them, and you know,
nobody had access to computers.

176
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:37,220
And the idea that you could have your own computer and do
whatever you wanted to with it,

177
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,937
whenever you wanted to, was fantastic.

178
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,945
And where was this all happening? It was far from Silicon Valley,
Intel, or IBM.

179
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:57,236
Out in the desert near the airport in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
Ed Roberts ran a calculator company called MITS.

180
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,875
Having an ugly building wasn't it's only problem:
MITS was going bankrupt.

181
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,973
Nobody was buying calculators and Ed needed $65,000
just to stay afloat.

182
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,419
And we went to the bank, we had a late night meeting,

183
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:16,324
and the issue was whether we closed MITS down or they loaned us
an additional sixty-five thousand

184
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,891
and I was asked how many machines that I think we would sell
in the next year after it was introduced,

185
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:25,868
and I said eight hundred, which was considered
a wild-eyed optimist at that.

186
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:30,110
Within a month after it was introduced we were getting 
two hundred and fifty orders a day.

187
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:34,219
The Altair wasn't even a computer, it was a computer KIT.

188
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:37,930
- Wow this is a pretty well equipped machine.

189
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:45,221
You had to build it yourself and even then it usually didn't work. 
Still, the demand was amazing.

190
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:50,656
 There were actually people that came to MITS, a couple of people
with camper trailers 

191
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:56,621
and camped out inthe parking lot waiting for their machines. 
I mean, they were so eager.

192
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,393
I mean I think everybody had sort of daydream, 
Ed Walter Mitteyed about owning a computer.

193
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:06,430
The surprise was that it would be possible for the
average college student, for example,

194
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,539
who was living on bare subsistence, to actually buy a computer.

195
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:17,540
 This is what really amazed me was that people were so,
there was a sort of pent up demand

196
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,083
for having your own computer.

197
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,458
And if it could be that cheap what a wonderful thing.

198
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:33,206
This is an Altair computer - the first personal computer. 

199
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:39,437
And not just any Altair - this is Altair serial number 2,
the second one made.

200
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:45,136
The first Altair made was sent off to be photographed 
at a magazine and was lost in the mail.

201
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,850
So this is the oldest personal computer in the world.

202
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,753
Pretty historic junk but the question is what do you do with it?

203
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,970
I mean it has a front panel with switches that you can click
back and forth and some lights

204
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:07,273
but in the back there's no place to connect a keyboard, there's no
place to connect a monitor, there's no place to connect a printer,

205
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,980
in fact there practically nothing at all that you can really do 
with this thing

206
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,950
but back then 1975, the people who had it were thrilled.

207
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,627
The nerds formed clubs to talk about their new toy.

208
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:32,989
One of the first was the Homebrew Computer Club, which met on
Wednesday evenings in a hall rented from Stanford University

209
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:34,182
in Silicon Valley.

210
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,484
Presiding over near-anarchy was Lee Felsenstein who pretended
to be in charge.

211
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:42,401
And I would start the meeting by making a horrendous loud noise

212
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:46,643
because everyone was talking and I had to get some attention somehow.

213
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:53,005
And I would use it to call upon the person in question.
I'd make threatening gestures with it.

214
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,490
Most of us were in the electronics industry to a certain extent, 
there was also a stratem of physicians

215
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:06,128
and there were a lot radio amateurs for instance finding a new 
technology that wasn't stale.

216
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,756
But most of us were at a sort of middle level or downwards.

217
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:17,793
We saw ourselves as crazed ignored geniuses or possibly geniuses

218
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:22,698
but at least we could each hope to get our hands on a computer 
of our own.

219
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:33,700
The very uselessness of the Altair is what drove the hobbyists together.
Roger Melen and Harry Garland started an early computer company.

220
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:38,590
They came here to meet others and to figure out just what the heck
could be done with this new toy

221
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,581
a solution in search of a problem.

222
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,835
The Altair was tedious to use. 

223
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,269
At first, the only way that data and instructions could be given 
to the computer, was by flipping switches.

224
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:52,921
Take something trivial like 2+2.

225
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:58,223
Each 2 needed eight different switches to be flipped, then a ninth
switch was used to load them all.

226
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:06,044
'And' required another nine switches. The answer 4 was if the third
light from the left turned on. Eureka!

227
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:12,009
So if you had a program that was a hundred bytes long you had
to go this procedure a hundred times to load that in the memory.

228
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,467
- It took a long time.

229
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:17,709
And what happened if you lost power or if you lost
your way in the middle?

230
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,299
You cried.

231
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:24,602
The Altair may have been frustrating, but it drove the nerds 
to experiment,

232
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:30,169
finding real uses for the useless box, turning it from a curiosity 
to a computer.

233
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:37,327
Steve Dumpier set up an Altair, ehm laboriously keyed a program
into it.

234
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:44,352
Somebody knocked a plug out of the wall and he had to do that 
all over again but nobody knew what this was about.

235
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:47,666
After all, was it just going to sit and flash its lights? No.

236
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:51,245
You put a little eh transistor radio next to the Altair

237
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:56,710
and he would by manipulating the length of loops in the sofware,
could play tunes.

238
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,380
The radio began playing 'Fool on the Hill'....Da da da, da da da....

239
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:09,936
and the tinny little tunes that you could tell were coming from the
 noise that the computer was generated being picked up by the radio.

240
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,985
Everybody rose and applauded.

241
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:19,745
I proposed that he receive the stripped Philips Screw Award for 
finding a use for something previously thought useless.

242
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,900
But I think everybody was too busy applauding to even hear me.

243
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:28,229
It was a very exciting thing, it was probably the first thing 
the Altair actually did.

244
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:39,231
Turning the Altair into a useful tool required a programming language
so users could type their programs in rather than flipping switches.

245
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:44,820
What it needed was a version of some big computer language 
like BASIC, only modified for the PC.

246
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,498
This was called a BASIC interpreter, but it didn't yet exist because
the experts all thought

247
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:55,137
that not even BASIC was basic enough to fit inside the tiny
Altair memory.

248
00:22:55,137 --> 00:22:57,789
Yet again the experts were wrong.

249
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:05,079
Here comes the guy who solved the problem. 
Twenty years after finishing the first microcomputer BASIC,

250
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:08,526
Paul Allen is returning to Albuquerque for a celebration of that event,

251
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,130
this time with his $15 million jet and three foot red carpet.

252
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:20,480
At a time when I was killing brain cells, this guy was founding 
an empire.

253
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,011
He has come to eat rubber chicken in honor of the Altair's 
20th anniversary.

254
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:30,265
I'd like to introduce to you - Paul Allen.

255
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,858
Allen co-founded Microsoft with his younger buddy from high school,
Bill Gates.

256
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,955
One day in Boston, I was in Harvard Square I saw a cover of 
Popular Electronics with this thing that looked like

257
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:53,595
what I had been imagining, and so I grabbed it off the shelf, 
I looked at it and I bought it and

258
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:00,350
I ran back to Bill's dorm, and I think he was probably playing poker 
that night and usually losing money at that point. 

259
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:05,290
One of the few times when that's been the case.

260
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:11,070
Paul showed that to me and then okay, here was a company 
that would be needing software.

261
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:16,129
And he said OK we gotta call these guys up and see if this thing's 
for real.

262
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:22,757
We realised that things were starting to happen, and just because 
we'd had a vision for a long time of where this chip could go,

263
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,745
what it could mean er,

264
00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:30,313
that didn't mean the industry was going to wait for us while I stayed 
and - and finished my Degree at Harvard.

265
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:36,278
So called up Ed you know, we told him we've got this Basic and
it's you know just for your machine, and it's, you know,

266
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:39,592
not that far from being done, and we'd like to come
out and show it to you.

267
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:43,502
So we created this BASIC interpreter. Paul took the paper tape er, and

268
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:51,257
and flew out. In fact, the night before, he - he got some sleep while
I double checked everything to make sure

269
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:53,709
that we had er, had it all right.

270
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:57,421
But I had no idea what it was really going to be like to try to 
run the software.

271
00:24:57,421 --> 00:25:00,810
It had never been run on an actual computer before.

272
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:03,950
He was very nervous about whether this would actually work.

273
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:10,013
And then he got to the office and we all gathered around him 
and he put his fingers on the switches

274
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:14,670
and he loaded BASIC with paper tape into the Altair.

275
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,359
I was just I was so nervous....this is just....it's not going to work 
and it worked.

276
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:23,269
And it came up, and it could do a few little simple things.

277
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:26,517
And it was amazing when Paul called me up and said the thing 
had worked the first time.

278
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:28,969
And of course, it was incredibly fast.

279
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:34,420
And it printed out memory size and I think Bill said 
"it printed something!". So I said yeah, yeah.

280
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,712
Oh, that was - that was unbelievable. The fact that it really worked

281
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:41,429
er, was - was - was a breakthrough.

282
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:48,919
Maybe there wouldn't be a Microsoft if the screen hadn't come alive,
who knows, it might all be quite different.

283
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:59,110
After the demo succeeded, Bill forgot about finishing university.

284
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,174
Afraid of missing his chance to dominate the new industry,

285
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:06,350
he joined Allen in what was then the the center of world 
microcomputing research

286
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:10,658
among the sleezy bars and gas stations of Albuquerque, New Mexico.

287
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:18,479
And they lived across the street from MITS in the Sundowner Motel,

288
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:22,389
and the prostitutes and the drug dealers out on the corner,

289
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:31,270
and they were writing BASIC for the Altair computer, and gradually
 they actually started Microsoft here in Albuquerque.

290
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:36,970
We hired some of our high school friends basically to come down and

291
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,350
eh stay with us in our apartment, which became very crowded.

292
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:46,846
We were pretty young. We started when I was 19 and so we just had
a lot of - a lot of energy.

293
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:54,203
They worked really hard. They listened to really loud music, 
I could hardly stand to go to the software room sometimes

294
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:58,690
because the music would be banging off the walls, mostly acid rock.

295
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:08,784
You know we'd usually go out, eat pizzas and then go out and watch
action movies.

296
00:27:12,827 --> 00:27:19,720
They would work all night long, and there were days when Bill Gates
would be sleeping on the floor in the software lab.

297
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:25,486
Sometimes it would be Bill and these two other guys all,
you know, sitting on tables around the apartment

298
00:27:25,486 --> 00:27:29,529
with stacks and stacks of paper writing, converting the BASIC 
for the 8080.

299
00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:35,361
I still know the source code by heart, and that was er, er,

300
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:40,001
a work of love, you know, we just kept tuning and tuning that thing.

301
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:42,983
And - and so that kind of craftsmanship paid off.

302
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,798
BASIC let the Altair be used for both fun stuff and real work.

303
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:58,120
People attached terminals to the computer and began writing games,
word processors, and accounting programs.

304
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:03,540
Most of us didn't notice but soon there was thriving industry
for enthusiasts.

305
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:08,832
By the end of 1975, dozens of other companies 
were building microcomputers.

306
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,405
We created an industry and I think that goes completely unnoticed.

307
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,773
I mean there was nothing - every aspect of the industry when you talk
about software, hardware, application stuff,

308
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:21,159
dealerships, you name it, it was all in a mess.

309
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,142
It was a wild time. It was a very exciting time.

310
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:31,698
and the first user convention - where we got people to come in and 
tell us what they were doing, what they were excited about,

311
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:39,320
and other companies like Processor Technology or Imsai or Comemco
got going as add-on companies.

312
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,821
These companies are long-forgotten, but they were the - 
the humble beginnings of the - of the PC industry.

313
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:52,443
Left in the hands of those early hobbyists the PC might never have
made it to the shopping mall.

314
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,180
Reaching the wider market required a different type of vision.

315
00:28:56,552 --> 00:29:02,649
Enter the flower children of California, who thought the PC was, 
well, groovy.

316
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:17,695
Remember that the Sixties happened in the early Seventies, right,
so you have to remember that and that's sort of when I came of age.

317
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:23,040
So I saw a lot of this and to me the spark of that

318
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:30,089
was that there was something beyond sort of what you see every day.

319
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:38,220
It's the same thing that causes people to want to be 
poets instead of bankers.

320
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:46,194
And I think that's a wonderful thing. And I think that that same spirit
can be put into products,

321
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:50,237
and those products can be manufactured and given to people 
and they can sense that spirit.

322
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,840
To help you understand all this, I will now take off my clothes.

323
00:29:55,804 --> 00:29:58,820
- And he says well frame relay is scaleable.

324
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:03,270
Jim Warren knows better than most what the hippy movement 
did for the PC.

325
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,271
A sixties radical himself, he staged the West Coast Computer Faire

326
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:10,260
for a time the biggest computer show in the world.

327
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:15,224
The Faire was where the PC really arrived. It's also where Jim got rich.

328
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:18,803
- So eh Jim is this where you hold all your meetings?

329
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:23,641
- Uhm as many as possible - sure why not.

330
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:26,889
- This is how silicon vallye entrepreneurs conduct business?

331
00:30:28,214 --> 00:30:32,721
Believe it or not, Jim once taught mathematics at a 
Catholic girls school.

332
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:40,343
Jim was immediately fascinated by the PC like many Bay Area hippies.

333
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,710
The California counter culture was crucial to the PC's development.

334
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,695
And the whole spirit there was working together, was sharing.

335
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:55,985
You shared your dope, you shared your bed, you shared your life, 
you shared your hopes.

336
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,420
And a whole bunch of us had the same community spirit

337
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,071
and that permeated the whole Home Brew Computer Club.

338
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:09,638
As soon as somebody would solve a problem they'd come running
down to the Home Brew Computer Club's next meeting and say:

339
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:12,820
hey everybody you know that problem that all of us 
have been trying to figure out how to solve,

340
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,139
here's the solution, isn't this wonderful?

341
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,134
Aren't I a great guy?

342
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,099
And it's my contention that that is a major component of why 
Silicon Valley was able to

343
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:27,798
develop the technology as rapidly as it did, 
because we were all sharing - everybody won!

344
00:31:29,058 --> 00:31:32,372
Out of this creative show-and-tell came Apple Computer,

345
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,890
the first mass market PC company.

346
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:40,600
The Apple founders, a couple of recent graduates from 
Homestead High were regulars at Homebrew meetings.

347
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:43,109
Steve Wozniak was the technical wizard

348
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:48,013
and Steve Jobs was the visionary who saw microcomputers 
as a possible business.

349
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:51,320
The first Apple computer was primitive.

350
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:55,420
It was cobbled together by Woz to impress his friends 
at the Hombrew meetings.

351
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:59,281
Everybody was interested in computers so I started getting
a crowd around me

352
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:02,595
because even although I was too shy to raise my hand 
and say anything in a club meeting

353
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:09,289
after the club meetings I would put my computer that I had built and
every week it had a little bit more working on it too

354
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,199
but I would set it down and let people type on the keyboard 
and I would explain what's in it

355
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:16,049
If they would come up to me and ask the question I can answer

356
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:21,484
eh you know nowadays I would have the ability to tell them what it is
you know and be a little bit more promotional

357
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:23,870
but back then I could only answer questions that they asked me

358
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:26,322
but a kinda group started gathering around me.

359
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:29,172
And Steve Jobs saw that I had a lot of interest around me at the club

360
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,763
and he said "let's start selling it"

361
00:32:31,227 --> 00:32:37,987
and let's make this company. He came up with the name Apple
and eh and eh that's how it started.

362
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:46,736
Apple was at best a funky company...started by a couple of 
teenage hackers who

363
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:53,761
had previously been working as Alice in Wonderland characters in a
local shopping mall and they started it in this garage right here.

364
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:59,196
The first Apple computer was built here, now there are more than
ten million in use around the world.

365
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:02,775
And I was there - well for a short time I was an employee of 
Apple Computer,

366
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:07,216
employee number 12 and one day I helped move materials
out of this garage.

367
00:33:07,348 --> 00:33:13,247
At the time Steve Jobs said that the company was short of loot
so he offered to pay me in company shares,

368
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,218
but I held out for the money - 
my mother still reminds me of that incident.

369
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:22,990
The Apple 1 was even less of a computer than the Altair

370
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:27,828
a single circuit board that came with neither a case nor a keyboard.

371
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:31,805
Still, Steve Jobs managed to sell 50 Apple 1's.

372
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:37,306
That experience showed Jobs there was a market for a real computer:
the Apple II.

373
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:42,873
It was very clear to me that while there were a bunch of 
hardware hobbyists 

374
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:45,790
that could assemble their own computers, or at least take our board

375
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:50,570
and add the transformers for the power supply and the case 
the keyboard and go get, you know, et cetera,

376
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,020
go get the rest of the stuff.

377
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:58,515
For every one of those there were a thousand people that couldn't 
do that, but wanted to mess around with programming

378
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:04,540
software hobbyists. Just like I had been when I was, you know, ten,
discovering that computer.

379
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:10,710
And so my dream for the Apple 2 was to sell the first real 
packaged computer.

380
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,355
Steve Jobs's dream was impossible.

381
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:19,194
It needed too many chips, making the product too complicated 
and expensive to build.

382
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,574
But Woz didn't know it was impossible.

383
00:34:23,502 --> 00:34:29,003
And then I got in to a way of why have memory for your TV screen
and memory for your computer, make them one,

384
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:34,305
and that shrunk the chips down, and I shrunk the chips here, 
and why not take all these timing circuits

385
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:38,216
and I looked through manuals and found a chip that did it in one
chip instead of five, and reduced that,

386
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:44,048
and one thing after another after another happened. 
I wound up with so few chips, when I was done I said:

387
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:48,223
hey, a computer that you could program to generate 
coloured patterns on a screen,

388
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,073
or data or words or play games or anything,

389
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:57,436
it was just the computer I wanted, you know, for myself pretty much,
but it had turned out so good.

390
00:34:57,502 --> 00:35:00,790
He said: "I think we have a computer we could sell a thousand
a month of."

391
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,440
How can you sell a thousand a month, you know?

392
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,306
 But we needed some money for tooling the case, things like that,
we needed a few hundred thousand dollars.

393
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:12,216
That was a lot of money for two people who had nothing in their lives

394
00:35:12,216 --> 00:35:14,403
to speak of, didn't have a 400 dollar bank account.

395
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,789
So I went looking for some venture capital.

396
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,350
The scruffy 19 year-old seduced the conservative world 
of venture capitalists.

397
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:25,936
The man Jobs persuaded to part with his cash was Arthur Rock,

398
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:30,180
the inventor of venture capital and the man who had 
originally funded Intel.

399
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:34,880
At least the Intel boys had graduated from university 
and owned suits.

400
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:43,433
Well, he wore sandals and he had long, very long hair and 
a beard and a moustache,

401
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,958
but very articulate.

402
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:55,231
He was, I think at one time in his life, and it was probably when 
I first met him that he ate nothing but fruit.

403
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,500
- So as a mainline venture capitalist, is this...

404
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,371
- This is not the norm.

405
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,313
With money in hand and under occasional adult supervision from
an ex-Intel manager named Mike Markkula,

406
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:21,477
Woz & Jobs finished the Apple II and ordered a local factory 
to build 1000 machines.

407
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:28,502
Two years passed between the Altair and the Apple 2.
And in that time a lot of things changed.

408
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:34,401
We went from a computer that was designed for hobbyists and
engineers and certainly looked like a piece of test equipment

409
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:38,311
to a computer that looked like a piece of consumer electronics

410
00:36:38,643 --> 00:36:41,758
and we can thank Steve Jobs for that - his sense of design

411
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:47,855
demanded that this structural foam case be used for the Apple 2
the first case of its type on a personal computer.

412
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,904
And not that there wasn't good engineering inside either.

413
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:53,821
The Apple 2 was a model of efficient engineering,

414
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:59,520
here's the floppy disk drive controller for example. There are eight chips
here where previously there would have been thirty-five.

415
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,099
This is an amazing bit of engineering that we can attribute to 
Steve Wozniak

416
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:10,456
who is certainly the Mozart of digital design and all told it turned 
the Apple 2 into a sensation.

417
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:21,326
The Apple II was launched at Jim Warren's West Coast Computer Faire,
one of the first big microcomputer shows.

418
00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:25,501
The 1978 show drew thousands of attendees and dozens of exhibitors

419
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:30,737
many of them members of the Homebrew Computer Club,
which spawned most of the early microcomputer companies.

420
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:35,775
But there was only one company showing something 
that looked like a modern personal computer.

421
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:41,673
Right by the entrance, in a prime spot negotiated by Steve Jobs,
sat the Apple II.

422
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:44,788
It mesmerized all who saw it.

423
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,638
My recollection is we stole the show,

424
00:37:47,837 --> 00:37:53,206
and a lot of dealers and distributors started lining up and we were off 
and running.

425
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,730
- How old were you?

426
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:57,182
Twenty-one.

427
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:08,980
Following the West Coast Computer Faire, the next two years were
ones of explosive growth for Apple,

428
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,547
with thousands of customers literally arriving on the doorstep 
of the tiny office in Cupertino, California.

429
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:20,512
Sales and profits grew so quickly that Apple had more money than
the company could spend.

430
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:22,766
And the company was very young.

431
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:30,321
The founders were in their twenties and some employees were 
even younger, like 14 year-old Chris Espinosa, who never left.

432
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:33,238
He still works at Apple, almost 20 years later.

433
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:39,203
And there would be public demonstrations of our product every 
Tuesday and Thursday afternoon at 3 o'clock

434
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,456
and that was good because it was after school.

435
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:45,830
So I would get out of my, you know sophomore-junior year 
of high school,

436
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:52,657
I would ride my little moped down to the Apple offices and at 3 oÍclock
I'd give the demonstrations of the Apple 2.

437
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:57,694
When we were in the office it was hey jokes and we were wiring up
people's phones to do weird things,

438
00:38:57,694 --> 00:39:04,587
ust every one of us I mean there wasn't a person in Apple I don't think 
for a couple of years that was you know super serious.

439
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:08,431
We were lucky, we had like the hot product of its day.

440
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:13,020
And some of the people that I did original demos to came up to me
years later and said:

441
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:16,451
"you know I founded a hundred million dollar chain of computer stores"

442
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:21,422
based on the demo you showed me one Tuesday afternoon at Apple. 
It was really fun.

443
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,880
It went so successful that all of a sudden Steve and I wouldn't have to 
worry about work for the rest of our lives.

444
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,303
And then it got even more successful and more successful after that,

445
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,744
and eh it was sort of a shock.

446
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,920
The Apple II set a new standard for personal computers

447
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,450
and showed there was some real money to be made.

448
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:45,481
Rival companies popped-up all over, but the market was still hobbyists

449
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:50,849
guys with big beards who thought a good use for their computer was 
controlling a model train set.

450
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:59,200
But for microcomputers to be taken seriously, they had to start 
doing things that needed doing,

451
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,050
functions that were useful, not just for fun.

452
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:12,390
 The enthusiast had its limits. To reach the rest of us the Apple 2
 needed what nerds call a killer application.

453
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:16,631
Software that's so useful that people will buy computers just to run it.

454
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:24,320
For the Apple II, this application was called VisiCalc.
It came straight from the blackboards of the Harvard Business school.

455
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:31,320
Invented by a graduate student, Dan Bricklin with his programmer friend
Bob Frankston,

456
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,792
VisiCalc was the first electronic spreadsheet.

457
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,569
A spreadsheet is a tool for financial planning,

458
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:44,004
bringing together for the first time the seduction of money 
with the power of microcomputing.

459
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:46,921
Dan Bricklin's professor at Harvard

460
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:51,891
showed how companies used a grid of numbers on a blackboard 
to work out profits and expenses.

461
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:58,055
- Sixty down here and your profit would be this minus this which 
gives you forty.

462
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,790
- And then well let's see what's the sales growth, say there's a 
ten percent...

463
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:06,208
The trick to a spreadsheet is that all the values in the table 
are related to the others.

464
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:12,305
So changes in one year would ripple through the table, 
affecting prices and profits in subseqent years.

465
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:18,336
Students were asked to calculate how future profits would be affected
by various business scenarios.

466
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,578
It was called running the numbers and they did it laborously by hand.

467
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:29,935
- Well let's say your initial costs have a hundred fixed costs at the beginning
so now you have a minus twenty

468
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:36,430
- is how much you make the first year and in the second year you have 
a hundred but your variable is say

469
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:41,998
- let's say twenty-five so now your losing, what is it, it's a pain in the neck 
I wasn't very good at this stuff,

470
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:49,686
- eightyfive 
- no no no - fifteen - minus fifteen right and eventually your making money,

471
00:41:49,686 --> 00:41:54,590
- what year do we make money and how much does the cost of money 
that's what running numbers was...

472
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:59,495
Because each value was linked to others, one mistake 
could mean disaster.

473
00:41:59,495 --> 00:42:04,400
- ...it blows your all number afterwards because you make all your 
calculations based on the other numbers before them.

474
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,316
Dan, who had worked as a programmer,

475
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:13,460
started daydreaming about how he could use a computer 
to replace the tedious hand calculations.

476
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:18,185
- I imagined that there was this magic blackboard that did like 
word processing does word wrapping

477
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:23,355
- if you make a change to a word it automatically pulls everything back,
well why no recalculate in the same way?

478
00:42:23,355 --> 00:42:27,597
- So that if I change my number, you know, I should have used ten per cent
instead of twelve per cent,

479
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:31,043
- I could just put it in and it would recalculate everything 
and go through it you know 

480
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:34,622
- and that would be this idea of an electronic spread sheet.

481
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,360
Following a model that's common today, Dan Bricklin designed
the program,

482
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,239
but got his friend Bob Frankston to write the actual computer code.

483
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:47,878
After months of programming late at night when computer time 
was cheaper,

484
00:42:47,878 --> 00:42:50,927
the Harvard Business School blackboard came to life.

485
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:55,500
- Now we've set this up, OK. Then we type a new value in, then 
I'm going to take that one hundred,

486
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,869
- I'm going to change it right and here, it recalculated! Woa! 
That saved me so much time!

487
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,177
People who saw it and went and got it like an accountant, 
I remember showing it

488
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:12,202
- to one around here and he started shaking and said: 
"that's what I do all week, I could do it in an hour you know,"

489
00:43:12,268 --> 00:43:15,380
- you know, they would take their credit cards and shove them
in your face.

490
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,161
I meet these people now they come up to me and say 
"I gotta tell you you know..."

491
00:43:19,294 --> 00:43:22,741
(BOB): You changed my life.
(DAN): You changed my life. You made accounting fun and...

492
00:43:22,939 --> 00:43:27,313
- You have to remember what it was like in those days we did not use 
the word spreadsheet

493
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,302
- cause nobody knew what a spreadsheet was.

494
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:35,532
- I came up with the name visible calculator or visicalc because 
we wanted to emphasise that aspect.

495
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:41,365
VisiCalc hit the market in October, 1979, selling for $100.

496
00:43:41,563 --> 00:43:45,938
Marv Goldschmitt sold the first copies from his computer store 
in Bedford, Massachusetts.

497
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:49,185
After a slow start VisiCalc took off.

498
00:43:49,848 --> 00:43:53,200
What it did in our society, it gave people who were obsessed 
with numbers,

499
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:55,217
whether they were in business or at home,

500
00:43:55,415 --> 00:44:00,320
how much am I worth today, what's my stock portfolio worth, how
am I doing against budget on this project.

501
00:44:01,447 --> 00:44:06,616
It gave them an ability to play with scenarios and change it and 
say well, what if I do this.

502
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,262
So it put people in a sense in control 

503
00:44:10,262 --> 00:44:14,040
of the thing that lots of people in our society feel is driving 
them and that's numbers.

504
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:21,330
The spreadsheet was every businessman's crystal ball.

505
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,102
It answered all those 'what if' questions. 
What if I fire the engineering department?

506
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:30,344
What if I invest $10 million in pantyhose futures? 

507
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:35,712
Look! I'll be rich in under a year and have slimmer thighs 
at the same time!

508
00:44:35,712 --> 00:44:37,833
The Computer says so!

509
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:47,245
The effect of the spreadsheet was enormous.

510
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,222
Armed with an Apple 2 running Visicalc a twenty-four year old MBA

511
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:54,867
with two pieces of dubious data could convince his 
corporate managers

512
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:58,247
to allow him to loot the corporate pension fund and do a 
leverage buy-out.

513
00:44:58,247 --> 00:45:00,501
It was the perfect tool for the eighties...

514
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:04,809
the lead decade where money was everything and greed was good.

515
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,622
In five years, the PC had gone from a hobbyist's toy
to an engine that shaped the times we lived in. 

516
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:40,533
Thanks to VisiCalc the Apple II made history.

517
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,106
Everybody you talked to just seemed excited about talking
about what we were doing.

518
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:50,607
And there was this huge media explosion, kind of like the Internet
is receiving today,

519
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:54,186
of this is the happening thing. You read about it over and over
and over,

520
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:57,990
and every time you took an airplane flight you read about it, 
in every newspaper every week you'd read something

521
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,476
about small computers coming, and Apple was one of the 
highlight companies

522
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,090
so we were being portrayed as a leader of a revolution,

523
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:09,165
and we really felt that we were a leader of a revolution. 
We were going to change life a lot.

524
00:46:10,954 --> 00:46:14,931
Pretty good for a company started in a garage three years before.

525
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:22,155
But not all the PC pioneers made great fortunes. Dan Bricklin decided
not to patent his spreadsheet idea.

526
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:26,264
Though more than 100 million spreadsheets have been sold 
since 1979,

527
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,910
Bricklin and Frankston haven't earned VisiCalc royalties in years.

528
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,428
You know, looking back at how successful a lot of other people

529
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:34,748
have been it's kind of sad that we weren't as successful...

530
00:46:35,013 --> 00:46:37,863
It would be very nice to be gazillionaires,

531
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:45,618
but you can also understand that part of the reason was 
that that's not what we're trying to be.

532
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:50,191
We're kids of the Sixties and what did you want to do?
You wanted to make the world better,

533
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,035
and you wanted to make your mark on the world and improve things,
and we did it.

534
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:58,542
So by the mark of what we would measure ourselves by, 
we're very successful.

535
00:47:01,326 --> 00:47:03,248
And what about Ed Roberts?

536
00:47:03,513 --> 00:47:09,610
Three years and 40,000 computers after assembling that first Altair,
the fun was over for Ed.

537
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:14,581
MITS was just another player in what had become a 
competitive market for personal computers.

538
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:18,823
Roberts sold his company in 1978 and started a new life.

539
00:47:19,154 --> 00:47:22,932
He went back to his native Georgia and retrained as a doctor.

540
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:26,180
- I hadn't really thought anything at all about it for the last 
few years

541
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,030
- until people started taking credit for things that we did at MITS

542
00:47:29,427 --> 00:47:32,410
- eh that's the only thing I think about. It irritates me

543
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:35,194
- when I think about the things that we did at MITS and we took
 all the heat for

544
00:47:35,194 --> 00:47:37,513
- that other people have tried to take credit for

545
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:39,104
- and that frustrates me.

546
00:47:40,496 --> 00:47:45,599
While Ed Roberts invented the personal computer, 
it was the founders of Apple who got rich.

547
00:47:45,798 --> 00:47:49,178
When Apple went public in spectacular fashion in 1980,

548
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:51,896
Jobs and Woz became multimillionaires.

549
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,481
The nerds had inherited the earth.

550
00:47:55,143 --> 00:47:56,601
 I was worth...

551
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:02,301
...about over a million dollars when I was twenty-three

552
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:08,067
and over ten million dollars when I was twenty-four, 
and over a hundred million dollars when I was twenty-five

553
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:17,081
and ehm it wasn't that important ehm because I never did it 
for the money.

554
00:48:18,076 --> 00:48:22,317
It was just a little hobby company like a lot of people do 
not thinking anything of it.

555
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:26,228
I mean it wasn't as though we both thought it was going to go 
a long ways.

556
00:48:26,228 --> 00:48:28,216
It was like we'll both do it for fun

557
00:48:28,813 --> 00:48:34,778
but back then there was a short window in time where one person
 who could sit down and do some neat good designs

558
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:38,622
could turn them into a huge thing like the Apple 2.

559
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:58,505
It's astonishing that at the beginning of 1975 nobody owned
a personal computer

560
00:48:58,704 --> 00:49:02,018
all there was was a mock-up on a magazine cover

561
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,500
yet within five years there had emerged here in Silicon Valley 
a billion dollar industry.

562
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:10,435
An unhealthy fascination with technology on the part of a few 
adolescents

563
00:49:10,502 --> 00:49:13,086
had awakened the nerd within us all.

564
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,100
PC companies were sprouting like mushrooms to meet 
the enormous demand.

565
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:22,100
Apple had emerged as the top fungus and had taken fifty per cent
of the market.

566
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,547
To the boys in Cupertino, every day seemed like Christmas...

567
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:27,700
but Scrooge was around the corner.

568
00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:31,180
There was a company that everyone associated with the word 
'computer',

569
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:34,560
a company that expected, no demanded to dominate its market:

570
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:35,820
IBM

571
00:49:36,284 --> 00:49:38,073
Big Blue was on the move 

572
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:42,050
and Silicon Valley would soon be feeling the reverberations.

573
